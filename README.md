# TextAnalytics

<h2>Description</h2>
This project aimed to predict doctors' knowledge ratings using 80K patient reviews and different machine learning models.
<br />
<br />
I began by preprocessing the text data to suit Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including Lowercasing, Punctuation Removal, Number Removal, Whitespace Normalization, and Stopword Removal. The data was then tokenized, stopword-filtered, and recombined into processed strings to ensure optimal readiness for the modeling process.
<br />
<br />
After processing the text and pairing it with labels, the data is batched into sets of 32 to enhance model training efficiency. The dataset is then divided into training and validation sets. Utilizing TensorFlow Keras' TextVectorization layer, the text data is vectorized, preparing it for efficient processing by the deep learning model in subsequent steps.

<h2>Action </h2>
- Executed a quasi-experiment to investigate the effectiveness of three potential new educational programs at the learning center, analyzing an 18K student grade dataset with R.
<br />
<br />
- Applied linear regression to statistically compare the performance across different student groups to identify the improvement brought by new educational programs.
<br />
<br />
- Visualized the student grade comparisons by Tableau; compiled an analysis report with insights and recommendations, resulting in a <b>threefold improvement</b> in student scores compared to the original program.


<h2>Languages and Tools Used</h2>
